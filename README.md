# Arrays

# Big O Notation

**1. Basic_Array_Initialization:** The array initialization is *O(1)*, the for loop is *O(n)*, and the enchanced for loop is also *O(n)*; therefore, the complexity is *O(1)* + *O(n)* + *O(n)* = ***O(n)***.

**2. Array_Sum_Average:** The if-else statement is *O(1)*, the for loop is *O(n)*, and the sum/average calculation is *O(1)*; therefore, *O(1)* + *O(1)* + *O(n)* = ***O(n)***

**3. LinearSearch_IndexRetrieval:**

**4. Sorting_Array:**

**5. Matrix_Sum:**

**6. Matrix_Multiplication:**

**7. TicTacToe:**

**8. Two_Sum:**

**9. No_Twos_Or_Fives:**

**10. Remove_Duplicates:**

# What it does

# Challenges we ran into

# Accomplishments that I am proud of


# What we learned

We learned the importance of integrating better programming languages to enhance speed and code quality. Additionally, we gained valuable experience in using open-source resources and implementing them into our project. We also expanded our knowledge of CSS Grid and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes.
