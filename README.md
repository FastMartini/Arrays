# Arrays

# Big O Notation

**1. Basic_Array_Initialization:** 

The array initialization is *O(1)*, the for loop is *O(n)*, and the enchanced for loop is also *O(n)*; therefore, the complexity is *O(n)* + *O(n)* + *O(1)* = ***O(n)***.

**2. Array_Sum_Average:** 

The if-else statement is *O(1)*, the for loop is *O(n)*, and the sum/average calculation is *O(1)*; therefore, *O(n)* + *O(1)* + *O(1)* = ***O(n)***.
